# Custom User Model

However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

But how to implement one? The official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.

## Setup
To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

* create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
* install Django
* make a new Django project called config
* make a new app accounts
* start the local web server


Now use the logout link and then click on signup.

## Conclusion

Now that our custom user model is configured you can easily and at any time add additional fields to it. See the Django docs for further instructions.

You can also check out DjangoX, which is an open-source Django starter framework that includes a custom user model, email/password by default instead of username/email/password, social authentication, and more.
