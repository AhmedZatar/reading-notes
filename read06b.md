# CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

# Foreground Color 
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

1. RGB Values 

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. HEX Codes

These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3. Color Names

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

# Background Color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.
You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names
(covered on the next page).
If you do not specify a
background color, then the
background is transparent.
By default, most browser
windows have a white
background, but browser users
can set a background color for
their windows, so if you want
to be sure that the background
is white you can use the
background-color property on
the < body > element.

# Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

Text is harder to read when
there is low contrast between
background and foreground
colors. 

Text is easier to read when
there is higher contrast between
background and foreground
colors.

If you want people to read a lot
of text on your page, however,
then too much contrast can
make it harder to read, too.

You can reduce contrast by
using dark gray text on a white
background or an off-white text
on a dark background.
