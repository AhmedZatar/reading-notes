# Comparison Operators
You may be familiar with comparison operators from math class. Let’s make sure there aren’t any gaps in your knowledge.

* Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

* Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

* Less than or equal to (<=) — returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false. 

* Greater than or equal to (>=) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

* Equal to (===) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

* Not equal to (!==) — returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

# Logical Operators
Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.

There are scenarios, however, in which we must assert whether multiple values or expressions are true. In JavaScript, we can use logical operators to make these assertions.

* && (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.

* || (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).

* In the example above, we check if the string 'yellow' is equal to the string 'green' and (&&) if 4 is greater than or 
* equal to 4. Let’s break this down into the two comparison expressions.

The && operator requires that both expressions be true in order for the expression to be truthy. Because one expression is false and the other is true, the expression is falsy and evaluates to false.

# JavaScript Loops
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact.

There are two types of loops in JavaScript.

1. for loop

2. while loop

# For loop
The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below.

Example of for loop in javascript.

# while loop
The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known.
