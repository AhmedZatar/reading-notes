# STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

A statement is an individual instruction that the
computer should follow. Each one should start on a
new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your
code easier to read and follow. 

Some statements are surrounded by curly braces;
these are known as code blocks. The closing curly
brace is not followed by a semicolon

The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter
when a step is over, indicating that it should move
to the next step.

# Comments
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code

# VARIABLE
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

A variable is a good name for this
concept because the data stored
in a variable can change (or vary)
each time a script runs. 

# DATA TYPES 
1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE :
The numeric data type handles
numbers. 

fore example : 0.75 

2. STRING DATA TYPE : The strings data type consists of
letters and other characters.

fore example : 'Hi , a , A '

3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE : Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false. 

fore example : true , false

# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name. 
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.
4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases. 
5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age. 
6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
