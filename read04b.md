# What make a Computer a Computer
A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.

## there is four things common to all computers that is what make computers  a computer :

1. Input: is often sent to the computer from a device such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input device. Putting it simple, input is the act of entering data into a computer.

2. Storage : is the component within your computer that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis. Usually, storage comes in the form of a solid-state drive or a hard drive.
3. Processing: is an action or series of actions that a microprocessor, also known as a central processing unit (CPU), in a computer performs when it receives information. ... The instructions fed to a CPU by a software program alter the states of these transistors to perform calculations for the software program.

4. Output: Any information that is processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered output. An example of output is anything viewed on your computer monitor screen, such as the words you type on your keyboard. Without some type of output that a human could see, feel, or hear a human could not interact with the computer. In the picture, the bottom half shows data sent from a computer to a printer, which is considered a form of output.

# Binary & Data
Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit , is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1. Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), eg the binary number 1001. The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors .

# Circuits and Logic
A logic circuit is a circuit that executes a processing or controlling function in a computer.  This circuit implements logical operations on information to process it.

Logic circuits utilise two values for a given physical quantity (voltage, for example) to denote the Boolean values true and false or 1 and 0 respectively.  Logic circuits have inputs, as well as having outputs which can be dependent on the inputs.  In logic circuit diagrams, connection from one circuit’s output to another circuit’s input is displayed as an arrowhead at the input end.

When it comes to performance, logic circuits are similar to programming language functions.  The inputs are similar to function parameters while the outputs are similar to function returned values.  A logic circuit can accommodate multiple outputs.

## Two Types of Logic Circuitry:
1. Combinational circuitry: operates like a simple function. The output is based on the present values of the input.
2. State circuitry: this kind of gate performs like an object method. The output is not only based on the input.  It is also based on the historical inputs.  This is made possible by the memory embedded in the circuitry.
